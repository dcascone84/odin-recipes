    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Classic Italian Tiramisu is seriously one of the easiest recipes and is made with a sweet mascarpone filling and layered with espresso dipped lady fingers. It's truly perfection and I can't believe I haven't made it since culinary school. Instead of resorting to my usual cookie consumption for dessert for all of our recent parties, I changed it up and made Tiramisu. BRILLIANT. It takes almost no time to make and the recipe below is one that my culinary school instructor literally engrained into our brains during the dessert portion of our curriculum.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Espresso</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>mascarpone</li>
        <li>28 hard ladyfinger cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Whisk together the cocoa powder, espresso and vanilla in a bowl and set aside</p></li>
        <li><p>In a mixer or using a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Add in the salt, mascarpone cheese and continue to whip until smooth. Add the chilled cream and continue to whip, until light, creamy, smooth and can hold a soft peak</p></li>
        <li><p>Dunk each ladyfinger in the espresso mixture to absorb the liquid and start to line a 7x11 oval baking dish with the cookies. Top the first layer of cookies with Â½ of the whipped mascarpone mixture and use the back of a metal spoon to spread it into an even layer. Dust with cocoa powder. Repeat for another layer and then finish by dusting with cocoa powder on top. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
