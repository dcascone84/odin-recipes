    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chicken cutlet refers to a boneless skinless chicken breast that has been thinly sliced and pounded out to an even thickness. They're used frequently in Italian recipes such as chicken Picatta, chicken Francaise, chicken saltimbocca and chicken Marsala. You can also make cutlets from veal, pork, or beef.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Grated Cheese</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Add the breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, and ¾ cup cheese to a medium shallow bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then use your fingers to mix it together, working the garlic into the breadcrumbs until evenly distributed. </p></li>
        <li><p>In another medium, shallow bowl, whisk together 3 eggs with ½ cup cheese, a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tablespoon water until combined. </p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the flour into another shallow bowl or plate, season with salt and pepper and mix to combine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Slice: Take a whole chicken breast and lay it flat on a cutting board with the palm of your hand over top. Starting at the thickest side, use a long chef's knife or fillet knife to slice the chicken lengthwise into thirds. It's ok if they're not totally even. You can skip this step by purchasing thin sliced chicken breasts from the grocery story!</p></li>
        <li><p>Pound: Place a piece of plastic wrap over the sliced chicken breast, then use the flat side of a meat mallet to pound it out to be about ½ inch thick. Repeat with the remaining chicken. You can skip this step if your cutlets are already thin and even enough!</p></li>
        <li><p>Season each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Set up the breading station so that the chicken is on the far left, then next to it the flour, then the egg, then the breadcrumbs, and then a landing plate or pan to hold the breaded chicken.</p></li>
        <li><p>Take a piece of chicken and dip it into the flour to coat on all sides, then tap off the excess (*See note). </p></li>
        <li><p>Next, dip it in the egg mixture and let the excess drip off.</p></li>
        <li><p>Line a sheet pan with foil or paper towels, then top with a wire rack for draining.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium-high heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place 1-3 chicken breasts in at a time, depending on how many your pan can hold. Don't overcrowd the pan. </p></li>
        <li><p>Cook until golden brown on each side, then remove to a rack or paper towels to drain.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve immediately. or place in a 250 degree F oven for up to 1 hour before serving to keep warm.</p></li>
